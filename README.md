Welcome to my Scrabble Score Tracker!

It allows users to input the words they play while playing a game of Scrabble and tallies them up at the end. It takes the arithmetic out of this word game! Users can also remove any words they may have added in error or incorrectly with the push of a button.

At the end, the tracker displays the winner and final scores as well as what the best word was, who scored it, and how many points it earned.

Going forward, I would like to use local storage to save the number of wins for each player and include some other interesting statistics.
